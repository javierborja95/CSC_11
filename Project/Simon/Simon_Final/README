Thanks to professor Conrad for letting me use his Div_mod function. All the code is mine except
for that usefull function.

If you decide to follow the Frizing diagram, compiling instructions:
	gcc -lwiringPi -lpthread -o simon main.s functions.s div_mod.s
	./simon

Lpthread is for the wiring pi softToneCreate() function.

The only monitor output is a quick menu.
FIRST, you must press red to set a combination, this takes about five seconds.

Then you can press Green to play.
After you hear the start tone, wait a second for the first color to popup. Then follow
the color pattern. There are 32 max turns.

You lose when you mispress a color.
After you hear the lose tone you'll be back in the menu.

Press green to play again, or you can press red to reset the combination.
If you wish to cheat, press yellow to see/hear the pattern.

Blue exits the program.
